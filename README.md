### Getting Started

* Copy-paste the stylesheet <link> into your <head> to load our CSS.
 
```html 
<!-- Tourer CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/jquery-tourer.css">
```

* Since this is a jQuery plugin, make sure that the library was included first before including our <script>.

```html
<!-- jQuery -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
<!-- Tourer JS -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="dist/jquery-tourer.js"></script>
```

### Usage

* The tour-wrapper class serves as the over all container for all out the tour elements. It contains elements li.tour-step which are the "steps" of the tour.

```html
<ul class="tour-wrapper">
    <li class="tour-step" target="#logo">
        <span>Step 1</span>
        <div class="tour-content bottom">
            <h2>Step Number 1</h2>
            <p>
                This is a normal step. In larger displays, this is shown as a tooltip
                and the image is hidden. On devices with smaller screens, this will
                be shown as a modal.
            </p>
            <img src="assets/images/step-1.png" alt="step 1">
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<div class="tour-overlay"></div>
```

> #### .tour-overlay
> This acts as a "barrier" to prevent interaction to the actual webpage elements during mobile mode or when an unbound element is shown.

### Tour Steps

```html
<!-- Add 'unbound' class to always show modal instead of a tooltip -->
<!-- Use the target attribute to denote which element the step will be bound on -->
<li class="tour-step" target="#logo">
    <!-- Short Title (For Large Displays) -->
    <span>Step 1</span>

    <!-- Use classes [top, bottom, right, left] for Tooltip Placement -->
    <div class="tour-content bottom">
        <!-- Full Title (On Mobile Devices) -->
        <h2>Step Number 1</h2>
        <!-- Body -->
        <p>
            This is a normal step. In larger displays, this is shown as a tooltip
            and the image is hidden. On devices with smaller screens, this will
            be shown as a modal.
        </p>
        <!-- Image (Hidden on Large Displays) -->
        <img src="assets/images/step-1.png" alt="step 1">
    </div>
</li>
```

> #### Target Element
> Then target attribute accepts any single element jQuery selector string.

### Initialization & Methods

```js
// Initializate Tour Wrapper
// This is done automatically on page load
$('.tour-wrapper').tour();

// This creates two event listeners
$('.tour-wrapper').trigger('start-tour'); // Starts Tour
$('.tour-wrapper').trigger('stop-tour'); // Ends Tour

// These event listeners are automatically
// bound to the following buttons, respectively

$('.start-tour').click() // Triggers 'star-tour'
$('.stop-tour').click() // Triggers 'stop-tour'
```
